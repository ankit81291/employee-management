Getting MEAN application code
=============================

This is the code for the sample 'Loc8r' application that is built through the course of my book [Getting MEAN](http://www.manning.com/sholmes/).

Getting MEAN is published by Manning, and is currently available through their early access program: [www.manning.com/sholmes/](http://www.manning.com/sholmes/)

There are named branches for the various states of the code throughout the book, so far:

* `chapter-03-blank` **Chapter 3 start**: A blank Express 3.4.8 project
* `chapter-03` **Chapter 3 end**: Creating and setting up a MEAN project
* `chapter-04-view` **Chapter 4 mid-point**: The data is hard coded into views
* `chapter-04` **Chapter 4 end**: Building a static site with Node.js and Express
* `chapter-05` **Chapter 5**: Building a data model with MongoDB and Mongoose
* `chapter-06` **Chapter 6**: Writing a REST API: Exposing your MongoDB database to the application
* `chapter-07` **Chapter 7**: Consuming a REST API: Using an API from inside Express
